        <p className="leading-relaxed text-celtic-900">
          Born and raised in Cuba üá®üá∫, I graduated as an Automation Engineer from
          the Universidad Central &quot;Marta Abreu&quot; de Las Villas (UCLV).
          While studying, I discovered a passion for web development and
          actively participated in open source projects.
        </p>
        <p className="leading-relaxed text-celtic-900">
          With a proven track record of delivering high-quality work on time,
          I&apos;ve had the opportunity to work remotely with companies across
          the globe ‚Äî from the USA to Chile, Uruguay, and beyond. I thrive in
          Agile environments, where collaboration, iterative development, and
          continuous improvement are at the core of every sprint.
        </p>
        <p className="leading-relaxed text-celtic-900">
          A die-hard Boston Celtics üçÄ fan (notice the green all over), I
          understand the importance of teamwork. Just like on the court, where
          success relies on seamless collaboration, clear communication, and
          individual strengths complementing each other, I excel in working with
          teams. Whether it&apos;s mentoring developers, participating in code
          reviews, or contributing to technical documentation, I believe in
          fostering a positive team environment.
        </p>
        <p className="leading-relaxed text-celtic-900">
          Like any other engineer, I value well-crafted machinery, so my passion
          for crafting exceptional code is akin to building a meticulously
          designed Swiss watch. Just like each intricate component within the
          watch works together seamlessly, my code prioritizes clarity,
          structure, and reusability. This ensures not only a high-performing
          product today, but also a well-oiled machine ready for future
          enhancements and adaptations.
        </p>
        <p className="leading-relaxed text-celtic-900">
          I bring more than just technical expertise to the table. My
          collaborative spirit, meticulous attention to detail, and constant
          drive to learn new technologies make me a valuable asset to any
          project. From building dashboards and embeddable components to
          establishing CI/CD pipelines and modern UI systems, I&apos;m committed
          to delivering exceptional results that stand the test of time.
